Power Button
==================================

.. note::
    The power button is connected to GPIO26, if you want to change it to another pin, please refer to :ref:`change_config`.

You have 2 ways to get the Pironman to shut down.

#. Force Shutdown

    Pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds will let the Pironman power cut, but this method may damage the Raspberry Pi's files or leave some changes unsaved.

#. Safe Shutdown

    There is also a way to safely turn off the Pironman by pressing and holding the power button for 2 seconds after configuring it.
