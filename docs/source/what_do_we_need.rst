1. What Else Should We Prepare?
===================================

**Required Components**


* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

    Pirionman is fully compatible with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. If you have Raspberry Pi 1B+/2B/3B/3B+, you can use them as well, but the tower cooler inside the Pironman may not be as compatible.

* 5V/3A Power Adapter

    This 5V/3A power adapter plugs into Pironman's Power connector and powers all components. You can power the Raspberry Pi 4 separately if you are also connecting other devices that consume a lot of power.


* Micro SD Card

    As the Raspberry Pi is completely enclosed in the Pironman, we have reserved an additional micro SD port for you. The micro SD card you use should have a capacity at least 8GB.

**Optional Components**

* M.2 SATA SSD

    .. note::
        * The M.2 SSD interface only supports SATA protocol, not NVME/PCIe.
        * For more information on how to mount SSD to Pironman and the related configuration, please refer to ::ref:`ssd`.

    In the Pironman's mainboard, there is an M.2 SSD connector for installing your M.2 SSD.

    An M.2 SSD is a small form factor solid-state drive (SSD) that is used in internally mounted storage expansion cards. 
    M.2 SSDs conform to a computer industry specification and are designed to enable high-performance storage in thin, 
    power-constrained devices, such as ultrabook laptops and tablet computers.



* Screen

    To view the desktop environment of Raspberry Pi, you need to use the
    screen that can be a TV screen or a computer monitor. If the screen has
    built-in speakers, the Pi plays sounds via them.

* Micro HDMI Cable

    There are two Micro HDMI output ports on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and you will need a converter cable to connect it to your screen.

* Mouse & Keyboard

    When you use a screen, a USB keyboard and a USB mouse are also needed.


* Sound or Earphone

    The Raspberry Pi is equipped with an audio port about 3.5 mm that can be
    used when your screen has no built-in speakers or when there is no
    screen operation.
