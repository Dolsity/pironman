1. What Else Should We Prepare?
===================================

**Required Components**


* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

    The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs
    into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
    It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore
    computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and
    Python.

* 5V/3A Power Adapter

    To connect to a power socket, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has a Type C port (the
    same found on many mobile phones). You will need a power supply which
    provides at least 2.5 amps.

* Micro SD Card

    Your Raspberry Pi needs an Micro SD card to store all its files and the
    Raspberry Pi OS. You will need a micro SD card with a capacity of at
    least 8GB.

**Optional Components**

* M.2 SATA SSD

    .. note::
        The M.2 SSD hard drive interface only supports SATA protocol, not NVME/PCIe.

    In the Pironman's mainboard, there is an M.2 SSD connector for installing your M.2 SSD.

    An M.2 SSD is a small form factor solid-state drive (SSD) that is used in internally mounted storage expansion cards. 
    M.2 SSDs conform to a computer industry specification and are designed to enable high-performance storage in thin, 
    power-constrained devices, such as ultrabook laptops and tablet computers.



* Screen

    To view the desktop environment of Raspberry Pi, you need to use the
    screen that can be a TV screen or a computer monitor. If the screen has
    built-in speakers, the Pi plays sounds via them.

* Micro HDMI Cable

    There are two Micro HDMI output ports on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and you will need a converter cable to connect it to your screen.

* Mouse & Keyboard

    When you use a screen, a USB keyboard and a USB mouse are also needed.


* Sound or Earphone

    The Raspberry Pi is equipped with an audio port about 3.5 mm that can be
    used when your screen has no built-in speakers or when there is no
    screen operation.
