Install the HassOS
============================

**Step 1**

Raspberry Pi have developed a graphical SD card writing tool that works
on Mac OS, Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows, and is the easiest option for most
users as it will download the image and install it automatically to the
SD card.

Visit the download page: https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/. Click on
the link for the **Raspberry Pi Imager** that matches your operating system,
when the download finishes, click it to launch the installer.

**Step 2**

When you launch the installer, your operating system may try to block
you from running it. For example, on Windows I receive the following
message:

If this pops up, click onÂ **More info**Â and thenÂ **Run anyway**, then
follow the instructions to install the Raspberry Pi Imager.

Insert your SD card into the computer or laptop SD card slot.

**Step 4**

In the Raspberry Pi Imager, select the OS that you want to install and
the SD card you would like to install it on.

**Step 8**

If your SD card currently has any files on it, you may wish to back up
these files first to prevent you from permanently losing them. If there
is no file to be backed up, click **Yes**.
